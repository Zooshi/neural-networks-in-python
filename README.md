How to create a neural network in python and apply it to predict images 

Start creating your first neural network in python. We will use the famous mnist dataset which covers 60000 images of numbers between 0 and 9.
We apply deep learning in python to create a neural network with 1 hidden layer. You have two options. You can apply tensorflow or theano as backend.
We first preprocess our data to prepare it for training. We use 10 epochs to train our model. Afterwards we apply the updated model on our test dataset to get the accurracy of our model.
I use keras to implement the neural network since it's much more convenient then pure tensorflow code.
